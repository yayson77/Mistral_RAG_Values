Company Values

1. Choose Fearlessly:
Own your decisions. Make mistakes. Move on. Begin again.
Change is inevitable. And when life throws a lot of it at you, it’s sometimes easy to get caught up
in the uncertainty. Just remember that inside every moment, we have a choice. And we can choose fearlessness. Learn to trade fear for more productive behaviors to maximize your potential and chase your big ideas this year. ​​​​​​​

Take chances, think and act fearlessly, and inspire everyone in the chain to deliver.
Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress. Made a mistake? Take 5 minutes to identify three learnings and share them with your team.
Speak up and share your ideas if you haven't spoken in a team meeting this week. If you spot trouble, whether it's a potential issue or a roadblock, it's best to address this sooner than later.

2. Force Simplicity:
Drive clarity and create momentum.
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Focus on impactful work.  
This isn't just about simple always being better. Simplicity gets you to the important work and clarity helps define what you need to do there. Now is the time for each of us to ensure we understand the work we are responsible for, the outcomes we are focused on, and what we're driving towards. 

Be mindful when using and versus or. The former is a commitment to multiple tasks whereas the latter forces you to make a choice.
Communicate clearly when no further action is needed, leaving no room for ambiguity.
Learn how to say "no" when it makes sense. It can be hard to do, but it is important to have the tough conversations.

3. Include Consciously:
Bring people in. Drive success for everyone around you. Seek out diverse ideas and experiences to unlock better outcomes for our travelers and our company.  
We can't scale if we try to do everything alone. We're much more effective when we
work together, when we bring everyone into the process, and when we put the success of the group before the success of the self. How can you make sure your coworkers feels safe, heard, and cared for?

Unlock the collective intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving of your team by actively listening to everyone's voice in the room.
Take note of who is speaking in a meeting and who is listening. Don't be afraid to ask listeners to share their opinions.
Think about how you offer feedback. Focus on behavior instead of adjectives to avoid biases that may creep in.
During meetings with teammates from other countries, avoid using acronyms or colloquialisms. Also, be mindful of time zone equity.

4. Trust Each Other
We are all Expedians. We are accountable to each  other to deliver on our commitments and we trust each other to get it done.
Trust is about not looking over each other's shoulders or second guessing. It's about 
encouraging healthy debate and believing in the decision made. It's about accountability and
relying on one another to deliver the outcome. ​​​​​​​

Proactively seek out feedback – if in meetings, provide space and time to hear from others.
Create a culture of open dialogue on your team.
Ask clarifying questions during an exchange to ensure understanding between parties.
Reframe the word 'debate' to 'dialogue.' Then consider if the dialogue is getting richer. Are we learning from it? Are we building a practice that enables us to do better next time?
Communicate regular updates when working on a project as a way to hold yourself accountable. 

5. Go Get What's Next
We’re always hungry for a better future. We have big dreams - for ourselves, for the company, and for the possibilities opened up by travel.
We want to be at the front of the travel industry, and that means it's time to be ambitious and push ourselves. We need to look ahead to see how we can do better for the traveler, to help more kinds of travelers and to grow our business. It's not about finding a spot that feels good to settle into, but it's about coming to work every day to do better. ​​​​​​​

Maintain a growth mindset - Keep an open mind around new ideas, never close yourself off to changes that could lead to improvements.
Seek trends and analyze metrics. What has the past shown that you can use to improve the future?
Are you most focused in the mornings, afternoons, or evenings? Block time on your calendar accordingly for strategic thinking. Analyze the work you're doing and projects your team is working on and look for ways to optimize.
Challenge the status quo. Are your team's processes the most efficient way to handle matters or is there a better approach?
